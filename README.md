# SHPE-Budget-Tracker
Project Description
As the Treasurer of my Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) chapter, I automated the budget tracking process to eliminate manual data entry. This system updates each committee's budget instantly when they report expenses via a Google Form, displaying results in a Google Sheet.

Features
Real-Time Updates: Immediate budget updates on expense submission.
Eliminates Manual Entry: No more manual data entry, reducing errors.
Transparent Reporting: Committees can easily view their updated budgets.
